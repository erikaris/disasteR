# I.1 Number of reported disaster events 

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

df = readxl::read_xlsx('dibi.xlsx')
p <- df %>% group_by(Tahun) %>% summarise(jml_bencana = n()) %>% ggplot(aes(Tahun, jml_bencana, group=1)) + geom_line(aes(color='steelblue', size=0.5))
(gg <- ggplotly(p))
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
